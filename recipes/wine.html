    <p>Wine is an alcoholic beverage. It is a product of the fermentation of <strong>grappes</strong>. There are many sorts of wines, but the most famous
        are the <strong>red and white</strong>.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This wine making recipe yields easy homemade wine. You can choose whatever flavor you like, but my favorite is red. To complete this 
        project, you will need a sterile milk jug, a large latex balloon, and a rubber band. This wine is a bit stronger than regular table 
        wine and is excellent for cooking and drinking.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <p></p>
    <ul> 
        <li>4 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can frozen juice concentrate - any flavor except citrus, thawed</li> 
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 Â½ quarts cold water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
       <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
       <li> Combine sugar, juice concentrate, and yeast in a 1-gallon jug. Fill the jug the rest of the way with cold water. 
        Stir or shake well until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is well combined.</li>
       <li>Rinse out a large balloon; fit it over the opening of the jug. Secure the balloon with a rubber band.</li>
       <li>Place jug in a cool dark place. Within a day, you will notice the balloon starting to expand. As sugar turns to alcohol, 
        gasses will release and fill up the balloon.</li>
       <li>When the balloon has deflated, wine is ready to drink. It takes about 6 weeks total.</li> 
    </ol>
